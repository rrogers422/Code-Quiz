# Code-Quiz
Using HTML, CSS, and Javascript, I have created a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. When the user answers questions correctly their score goes up, and when they get a question wrong time is taken away from the timer. After they have answered all questions, their final score is shown and they are given the option to enter their Initials & score into the highscore list. This entry is saved into Local Storage until it is cleared.
